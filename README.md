# Phoenix-Code
This is a code of my Master's thesis project. It simulates the magnetohydrodynamic interaction of plasma accreting onto a magnetized neutron star.

I strongly suggest reading the SubmittedThesis.pdf to gain a understanding of the physical phenomena this code is modeling before trying to play with the code.

Note that setting the output rate of the data too high will very quickly result in enormous data files. Edit with caution.
